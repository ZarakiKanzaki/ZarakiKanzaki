# Hello there :wave:, I'm Davide Donadio (aka DONA)

**Something about me**

I've become a Software Developer because my childhood dream was to design and develop video games. 
When I got my first console, I remember being intrigued by the stories that could be created and conveyed to the audience. I dreamt of producing the same unforgettable experiences for the players, and this is what prompted me to pursue a career in the gaming industry.

In my free time, I'm a ravenous games consumer. I love card games and Pen&Paper RPGs, which I use to improve my storytelling skills and creativity. So whenever I have the opportunity, I attend Game Jams to have exciting experiences and get to know vibrant and creative people as passionate as me.

I'm currently working @ [Claranet Italy](https://www.claranet.it/) as Backend Developer, I'm also an Open Source enthusiast.
